#This code snippet will make a single call to the Studio Ghibli API's /films endpoint, convert the response from JSON to a list of dictionaries and save that list under the variable name data.
#Then you're creating a new file called films.json and you're serializing the Python list object back into valid JSON data to save it in that file with the help of the json module.
